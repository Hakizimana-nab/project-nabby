                          When you run this page on your PHP web hosting server, your result will look like this:
                          
                          
                          
                          As you can clearly see it has returned only those results which matches user_id and where messages is not null.

                          RIGHT;

 
         This command instructs PHP to select the database stored in the variable $database (in our case 
            it will select the database "your_database"). If the script cannot connect it will stop executing 
            and will show the error message: Unable to select database. The 'or die' part is useful as it 
            provides debugging functionality. However, it is not essential.
           

            Below lists example login code, it should work on any OS as there is no platform dependent 
            code for database connectivity in PHP
