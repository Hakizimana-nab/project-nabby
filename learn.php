              <r> learn to required skills</r>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is essential for web development because we use it to define the structure of a webpage, the content that will be displayed on the browser.
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language based on rules that we use to define and assign styles to the elements of our webpage.
                HTML works with CSS to create the webpages that we use every day on our browsers. Some webpages also use JavaScript.
                
             
               body & head:  display word you write in browser of your project 
               still working on it while in body you can display... 
               for ex: script code link after open folder and give file name:
               like index.html as syntax or extension of html file to forder
               and start to write code  as shown paragraph is where you  can 
               display on page working on it  and if you need to know more to 
               visited some website to get more experience on html and css 
               about on these language it main basic for beginners who start--
               programming he/she is where can start to become  great develop 
               of future if you know well and also we can learn more 
               within toturial of w3schools as link on page or visited 
               me as show  website  to get more skills and now I'm  going to 
               show other html tags you must know such as:

               These are examples of the most commonly used tags:

  html: All the content of the website should be contained within these tags.
  head: This element contains the title of the webpage that you can see on the tab of your browser and it contains the metadata of the webpage.
  body:This element contains all the visible elements of the webpage. The structure of the webpage has to be within these tags.
  (h1), (h2), (h3), (h4), (h5), (h6) These elements create headlines in order of importance from 1 to 6.
  p:A paragraph.
  a: a href="#">home</a>) A link to another webpage, of website, or to internal sections of the current webpage.
  strong: This tag lets us emphasize important text. It's displayed as bold text.
  em:  This tag lets us emphasize important text. It's displayed as italic text.
  form: This element represents a form.
  hr: A horizontal rule that can be used to separate paragraphs or sections of the webpage.
  input: An element that lets us create the components of a form. It can be a text input field or become a radio button or a checkbox.
  footer: A footer.
                ( (br),(p)(<option)(/option), (colspan) , (base),
                (are), (code),(address) ,
                elements need an opening tag and a closing tag),(big)>, (img),
                and also table tag such as  (table) ,(tr) , (td), (th)
                  (ol) ,(li) ,(div) ,(em), (ul ) etc
    
                  
                  Here we have an example of each type of list<br>

                  Ordered List

                  <ol>
                    (li) Blue (li)<br>

                    (li) Green (li)<br>

                    (li) Black (li)<br>
                  </ol>
                  
                  Unordered List

                  <ul>
                    (li) Blue (li)<br>

                    (li) Green (li)<br>

                    (li) Black (li)<br>
                  </ul > 
                  
                  <p>    ?>        

              after we applied css using frame work of style css :as you know that css stand for 
              Cascading Style Sheets used to make website to be iterative with client according 
              to output of them it can courage within product your produce to client or customers

              therefore we have type of css such as internal and external , input css , inline

              
              All of them are necessary to webpage or web application  and if you to insert class
              to our website alwayls we open link goes to that page 
              <br>ex: (<br> link rel ="stylesheets"href="style.css"<br> )<br>
              or may be can using inline css  to apply css to  webpage  etc<br> 
              also in html some time if know some basic on html and css your<br> become greater
              developer for future as font end to insert image in html using
             <br> (img src="img/jpg"width="100%"height="200px"); </br>
          
              <br><h1 style="color: blue">freeCode learn to get skills</h1></br>
              <!-- <?> -->

             
             </br> <img src="img/alone.jpg"width="60%"height="200px"></br>

           <br>
            final your may change html extension within [php extension] ex index.html we use index.php,
            that's enough to even you may continue to make search inorder to require more skills,
            and  watch w3 schools toturials to some need etc:</br>
