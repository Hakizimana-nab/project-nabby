              WELCOME TO Python :
               is Python? Executive Summary
               What is Python? Executive Summary<br>
               Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language<br>
               with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, <br>
               with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,<br>
               as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.<br>
               Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.<br>
               Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. <br>
               The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms,<br>
               and can be freely distributed.
        
           
                <p>
             Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.<br>
             Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast.<br>
             Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.<br>
             Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.<br>
             When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace.<br>
             A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables,<br>
             evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints,<br>
             stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.<br>
             The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.<br>
             On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add<br>
             a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

            <h2>TITLE HEADING : Explaination of Html and css</h2>
            <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2024</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
            <p>Some text.. HTML && CSS:
              html:its state with Hyper text markup language and also it is used 
              to make structure of webpage to be more iteractive and after applied
              style to html and while    
                 
              css: its state within calscoarding stylesheet also make also applied
              to structure of html and we going to see some benefit of applied class
              and using html  therefore open tag of html as show that:

              <r> learn to required skills</r>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is essential for web development because we use it to define the structure of a webpage, the content that will be displayed on the browser.
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language based on rules that we use to define and assign styles to the elements of our webpage.
                HTML works with CSS to create the webpages that we use every day on our browsers. Some webpages also use JavaScript.
                
             
               body & head:  display word you write in browser of your project 
               still working on it while in body you can display... 
               for ex: script code link after open folder and give file name:
               like index.html as syntax or extension of html file to forder
               and start to write code  as shown paragraph is where you  can 
               display on page working on it  and if you need to know more to 
               visited some website to get more experience on html and css 
               about on these language it main basic for beginners who start--
               programming he/she is where can start to become  great develop 
               of future if you know well and also we can learn more 
               within toturial of w3schools as link on page or visited 
               me as show  website  to get more skills and now I'm  going to 
               show other html tags you must know such as:

               These are examples of the most commonly used tags:

  html: All the content of the website should be contained within these tags.
  head: This element contains the title of the webpage that you can see on the tab of your browser and it contains the metadata of the webpage.
  body:This element contains all the visible elements of the webpage. The structure of the webpage has to be within these tags.
  (h1), (h2), (h3), (h4), (h5), (h6) These elements create headlines in order of importance from 1 to 6.
  p:A paragraph.
  a:(a href="#">home</a>) A link to another webpage, of website, or to internal sections of the current webpage.
  strong: This tag lets us emphasize important text. It's displayed as bold text.
  em:  This tag lets us emphasize important text. It's displayed as italic text.
  form: This element represents a form.
  hr: A horizontal rule that can be used to separate paragraphs or sections of the webpage.
  input: An element that lets us create the components of a form. It can be a text input field or become a radio button or a checkbox.
  footer: A footer.
                ( (br),(p)(<option)(/option), (colspan) , (base),
                (are), (code),(address) ,
                elements need an opening tag and a closing tag),(big)>, (img),
                and also table tag such as  (table) ,(tr) , (td), (th)
                  (ol) ,(li) ,(div) ,(em), (ul ) etc
    
                  
                  Here we have an example of each type of list<br>

                  Ordered List

                  <ol>
                    (li) Blue (li)<br>

                    (li) Green (li)<br>

                    (li) Black (li)<br>
                  </ol>
                  
                  Unordered List

                  <ul>
                    (li) Blue (li)<br>

                    (li) Green (li)<br>

                    (li) Black (li)<br>
                  </ul > 
                  
                  <p>             

              after we applied css using frame work of style css :as you know that css stand for 
              Cascading Style Sheets used to make website to be iterative with client according 
              to output of them it can courage within product your produce to client or customers

              therefore we have type of css such as internal and external , input css , inline
          
              <br><h1 style="color: blue">freeCode learn to get skills</h1></br>
              <p>

              All of them are necessary to webpage or web application  and if you to insert class
              to our website alwayls we open link goes to that page 
              <br>ex: (<br> link rel ="stylesheets"href="style.css"<br> )<br>
              or may be can using inline css  to apply css to  webpage  etc<br> 
              also in html some time if know some basic on html and css your<br> become greater
              developer for future as font end to insert image in html using
             <br> (img src="img/jpg"width="100%"height="200px"); </br>
             </br> <img src="img/alone.jpg"width="60%"height="200px"></br>

           <br> final your may change html extension within [php extension] ex index.html we use index.php,
            that's enough to even you may continue to make search inorder to require more skills,
            and  watch w3 schools toturials to some need etc:</br>
